# Maker's Challenge Source Code


This is the source code for team "meowmeowmeowmeow :3" in the 2025 [Makers of Change Challenge](https://www.swhd.org/makersofchange/). This GitHub repo is a part of the build process for code on the Raspberry Pi, which will be the heart of the project.

## Building

On the Raspberry Pi, within the user's home directory, run: 

`./build.sh`

in the terminal. This will automatically fetch the most recent changes to this repo and invoke `main.py`.

## Contributing

Only members of the team are allowed to contribute code. All pull requests from unpermitted persons will be denied.

This repo may become private in the future.

## Raspberry Pi Conduct

Ask me for the login to the Raspberry Pi.

The Raspberry Pi should be disconnected from the internet when not updating or building.

## Docs

Docs are to-be-built. Maybe when we get code to document?
